# Rock, Paper, Scissors! 

This application runs rock, paper, scissors in the console of your browser. The game will prompt you to choose either rock, paper, or scissors. Open the console to see the results.

As this is meant more to showcase the functionlity than to be a real game, the computer moves are always displayed in the console before the player inputs their move. This is so you can choose the result in real time and see how the counters are affected.

The game will repeat for five rounds, after which the console will read the winner, or result in a tie.
